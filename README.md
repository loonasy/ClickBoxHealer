# ClickBoxHealer

This project has been created to track my updates to the Click Box Healer addon for the MMO RIFT originally created by Solsis00.  For more information on this addon, please visit the Curse Forge page at https://rift.curseforge.com/projects/click-box-healer#p1.

I intend to update this addon for my personal use, and I make no promises go keep it updated in the future.  Please review the commit notes to see what has been changed.

## New Installation

1. Click the "Download Zip" button above and to the right of the list of repository files above.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to your RIFT Addons directory (typically, but not always, c:/users/USER_NAME/Documents/RIFT/Interface/Addons). If you cannot find it, you can always start the game, and then at character select click the "Addons" button, and then when the addons window opens, click the "Open Addon Directory" button. When you finish this step, you should have a directory like so: .../RIFT/Interface/Addons/ClickBoxHealer-master
3. Rename the extracted directory from "ClickBoxHealer-master" to "ClickBoxHealer"

## Upgrade Existing Installation

1. Click the "Download Zip" button above and to the right of the list of repository files above.
2. Go to your "ClickerBoxHealer" directory (typically, but not always, c:/users/USER_NAME/Documents/RIFT/Interface/Addons/ClickBoxHealer). If you cannot find it, you can always start the game, and then at character select click the "Addons" button, and then when the addons window opens, click the "Open Addon Directory" button.
3. Open the zip file you downloaded, and click to enter the "ClickBoxHealer-master" directory within it. Copy everything in it to your local "ClickBoxHealer" addon directory, overwriting all files.
